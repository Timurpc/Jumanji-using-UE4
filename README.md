# Find your way on Labyrinth in Jumanji
This is the kind of logical games and it includes some enemies and a hero who should finish the levels step by step by battling against those enemies and dealing with challenges on the ways. Besides, there are some different colored balls which means, players should find an appropriate ball that fix with the door as there are also a few doors. Then, the next step is on!


# Main Idea of the Project
The main idea is unreality that is based on reality. What does it mean? In our game, unreality would be a hero, enemies, maze way and some challenges. Interestingly, why it is based on reality? Because, we can see a hero as a person, then enemies, maze way and challenges could be seen real difficulties and problems in our real life. More specifically, there would be some enemies and a hero in our labyrinth game. A hero should find a true way in order to reach to the next level. In this way, a hero may face some challenges and enemies along his ways. There may be 4 or 5 levels. The difficulty of the levels is being increased step by step. So, players can learn somehow, how to overcome real life difficulties with the help of our game.


# Expected Effect
Hopefully, by playing our Jumanji game the players can gain extra gaming competences and skills. Then, their logical thinking may considerably be increased, somehow.  
Additionally, very important game techniques such as learning task management of the game and completing the task could be learnt along playing this game.
Besides, most people are tired of being busy with academic and non-academic life difficulties and stresses in todayâ€™s life. With our game, we have aimed to help people release their stresses somehow, and make fun by playing the game that we create soon.
